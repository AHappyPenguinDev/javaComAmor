17.15 (Stream Performance) Answer the following questions with regard to the stream pipeline in Fig. 17.7:

a) How many times does the filter operation call its lambda argument?
R: 10 times (Range closed includes 1 and 10)

b) How many times does the map operation call its lambda argument?
R: 5 times (5 even numbers)

c) If you reverse the filter and the map operations in the stream pipeline, how many times does the map operation call its lambda argument?
R: 10, because there is no more filtering, so all 10 ints are included in the map operation
