18.8 - What does the following code do?
* public void printInt(int n) {
*    if(n != 0) {
*        printInt(n - 1);
*        System.out.println( n);
*      }
*  }

R:  The code creates method printInt that takes an int as an argument.
    The method's body then checks if n is not 0. If it isn't, printInt is called recursively with n-1 as its argument
    and the value of n is printed on the screen
